            <!-- New questions related to smart irrigation -->
            <div id="smart-irrigation" class="faq">
                <h2>What is smart irrigation?</h2>
                <p>Smart irrigation uses technology such as sensors, weather data, and automation to optimize water use for crops, improving efficiency and conservation.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="benefits-smart-irrigation" class="faq">
                <h2>What are the benefits of smart irrigation?</h2>
                <p>Smart irrigation helps save water, reduce costs, improve crop yields, and minimize environmental impact by using water more efficiently and effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="smart-sensors" class="faq">
                <h2>How do smart irrigation sensors work?</h2>
                <p>Smart irrigation sensors measure soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant needs to automatically adjust watering schedules and amounts.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="install-smart-irrigation" class="faq">
                <h2>How do I install a smart irrigation system?</h2>
                <p>Installing a smart irrigation system involves setting up sensors, connecting them to a central controller, and configuring the system to work with local weather data.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="cost-smart-irrigation" class="faq">
                <h2>What is the cost of implementing smart irrigation?</h2>
                <p>The cost of smart irrigation systems varies based on the complexity and size of the setup. Initial investment can be high, but long-term savings on water and increased crop yields often offset the cost.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="maintenance-smart-irrigation" class="faq">
                <h2>What maintenance is required for smart irrigation systems?</h2>
                <p>Regular maintenance for smart irrigation systems includes checking and calibrating sensors, cleaning emitters, and updating software for the control system.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Questions related to pH and crop health -->
            <div id="soil-ph" class="faq">
                <h2>Why is soil pH important for crop health?</h2>
                <p>Soil pH affects nutrient availability to plants. Different crops thrive at different pH levels.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="measuring-soil-ph" class="faq">
